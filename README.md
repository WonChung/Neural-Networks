# Neural-Networks
The purpose of this project is to  implement a small neural network with sigmoid activation functions, trained by backpropagation and to classify images from the MNIST handwritten digit data set.

## Running the Program
"nn_test.py" implements the unit tests for the functions in "neural_net.py".
To open "keras_mnist_1.ipynb", you will need to run "jupyter notebook".

Note: Jupyter notebook is a server-client application.

## Acknowledgments
This program was for a computer science class taught by Bryce Wiedenbeck at Swarthmore College. He provided starting code.
